It was an usual Friday evening until I found out that I have left the umbrella in a cornermost lecture room in the last floor. 
I knew for sure that even if I would have a magical power to keep myself not getting wet amidst the heavy rain, there is no way that I could escape from my mother who was anxiously waiting the umbrella to return home.
Blaming Mr. Marcus for not winding up the lecture on time, I started walking along the narrow corridor which leads to the staircase.
Fork report.
You are not alone.
I could hear anything other than my own footsteps. I was calm and quit until I found out that I was walking slower than the footsteps which I earlier thought to be my own.
Mr.Marcus took out a magical portion and poured onto a bowl for his dog to drink. After drinking it, the dog eventually started to grow rapidly and it died due to heart attack. On the otherhand, Mr Thomas made a device that can bring life to a dead body. So Mr.Marcus took his dead dog to Mr. Thomas to bring his dog back to life. Mr.Thomas fixed the device on to the dogs body and after few minutes, the dog gained consciousness and brought his dog back to life.
Mr.Marcus and his family were getting ready to go on a trip to Niagara falls. Mr.Harry and his family was travelling to Niagara falls by their brand new futuristic car. It had many new innovative tech features that even normal modern cars doesn't have. While they were going the trip, suddenly the car malfunctions and started to increase its speed drastically. Finally, the car went out of the road and it fell down the hill, destroying the entire car and killing all the family members.
